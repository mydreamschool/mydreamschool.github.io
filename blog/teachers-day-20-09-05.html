              these are the words from a great personality who, in his childhood
              dreamt of becoming a good teacher. He went on to become India’s
              second president and a great author and philosopher indeed.
              Sarvepalli Radhekrishnan, during his tenure as a president, was
              requested by his students and friends to celebrate his birthday.
              He replied that it would be his privilege to celebrate his birth
              date, 5th September as Teacher’s Day. Since then, September 5 is
              observed as Teachers’ Day.

            <h4>Relevance of Teacher's Day</h4>

            <p class="content">
              Why do we observe Teachers’ Day? Why do students play the role of
              teachers and teach on this day?
            </p>

            <p class="content">
              The day reminds us of many things- the changing nature of
              education, methods of teaching, and the most important relevance
              of a teacher in our lives. It is one of the most difficult tasks
              to change the attitude of someone. A teacher is entrusted with
              this task. This day also reminds us that the fruits that we enjoy
              today is the product of the hard work that a teacher puts to make
              our future better.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
              This day reminds us of the struggle that our teachers have faced.
              Dr. Radhakrishnan was born in a village but rose to prominence
              with the struggles echoing even today. The journey he made
              clearing hurdles after hurdles, is worth remembering one. We must
              acknowledge the hard work that our teachers put in order to
              transform our brains into creative minds.
            </p>

            <p class="content">This day also reminds us of the changing nature of technology, especially in the field of education. As technology changes so does the culture. Technology transforms traditional social relations and brings in new ways of living. It brings a body of knowledge which is further transmitted to the next generations. This is the basis of human development. We are the only species on this planet who can preserve,transform and  transmit technical know-how. Although, there are various means for transferring knowledge but the role of a teacher or mentor holds great significance.</p>

            <p class="content">
              In a comparison to teacher and god. Kabir said,

              <blockquote>
                गुरु गोविन्द दोऊ खड़े काको लागूं पायं। <br/>
                बलिहारी गुरु आपने जिन गोविन्द दियो बताय।। <br/>
                &mdash; कबीर 
              </blockquote>
            </p>

            <p class="content">
              The couplet means that when both the Teacher (Guru) and God (Govind) are standing before us, but the teacher is the one who has shown the way to know God. So we bow to the teacher first. 
            </p>

            <p class="content">
              In comparison to teachers and parents we know that a teacher is the one who stays with a pupil most of the time other than the parents. This is the reason, someone has rightly said that Parents are the first teacher and teachers are the second parents. So, teachers occupy the most important part of a student’s life. A student looks at teachers as their role model. They learn manners, attitudes, behavior from them. A teacher acts with authority to transform ill-perceived perceptions and prejudices into good manners and characters.
            </p>


            <h4>Transmission of knowledge - New Methods</h4>

            <p class="content">
              Nature has endowed humans with the capacity to remember information and preserve knowledge. The transmission of this knowledge by teachers to students is widely termed as education.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
              Teachers use several methods to transfer knowledge to students. In the early days with the growth of civilization, the methods were very simple as the body knowledge was primitive. Students learned through chanting to get them by heart and practice acts hundreds of times to make them muscle memory. As the body knowledge became complex, so did the methods of transmission.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
              In the 21 century, body knowledge has become huge and complex; the methods have also changed drastically. Now, we have various means of transferring knowledge. To understand the complex phenomena we have 3D graphics, animation, and even simulation. 3D graphics and animation help us understand how complex and confusing phenomena work in real-time. It helps to visualize and build mental models of complex concepts.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
              Simulation goes on to add us as a part of experiments. We can manipulate the factors affecting a phenomenon and see its effects on a real-time basis which completes the cause-effect cycle.
            </p>


            <h4>Role of Teachers in present times</h4>

            <p class="content">
              As teachers occupy an esteemed social position, their roles in transforming society are indispensable.  As the future generation is in their hands, they play an important role to transform a budding child into a responsible citizen.
            </p>


            <p class="content">
              Teachers in classrooms with their innovative teaching skills inculcate the feeling of “Give and Take”, “Think and Act”, and “Share and Care”.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
              A teacher also acts as a good counselor. A teacher is not only limited to covering up academics but they are someone with huge knowledge and practical experience.  Students and society look towards a teacher for advice.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
              A teacher encourages innovative and creative thinking in his students.  As Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam observed that his science teacher came into the class as an emanating source of knowledge.  He created and spread positive energy in the classroom, which helps ignite the minds of his students.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
              On this auspicious day, let’s  acknowledge the role of teachers. Let’s pledge to give due respect. Let’s  promise to obey them.  Let’s take a vow to make our teacher proud.
            </p>
